<p>Coupon Stash is a desktop application for keeping track of your
coupons, coupon usage, and coupon savings. Coupon Stash is written
in Java, JavaFX and FXML, by a team of 5 committed individuals
(including me). Featuring a command-line interface as well as
UI elements like calendars and graphs, Coupon Stash is an amazing
application and a prominent highlight of my abilities.</p>

<p>In this section, I will provide a brief summary of my contributions
to Coupon Stash, as well as to documents like the User Guide

<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: The <strong>savings</strong> feature allowing users to
keep track of how much they have saved from using coupons</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tracking savings per usage allows the user see how much they have
saved, over the course of a certain time period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This feature improves the product significantly because a key part
of coupons is the savings and benefits it brings to the user, and so
there is demand for knowing how much benefits you have reaped
easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This feature was not easy to add as it required consideration
about the various forms of savings that coupons may offer, such
as a percent off the original price, a flat monetary amount, or
even free gifts. Also, it required integration with other
features, like the "used" feature which allows users
to mark their coupons whenever they use them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added a "setcurrency" command so users
can customise the application to different regions, which
would be helpful for exchange students for example.</p>

<p>In order to calculate the total amount saved, <code>Coupon</code>s also
store information about how much the user saves, and storage
is done at the moment the user uses the coupon. This
information is stored in the form of <code>PureMonetarySavings</code>,
which is a subclass of <code>Savings</code> that never holds
<code>PercentageAmount</code>s. The class diagram below illustrates this.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reason why <code>PercentageAmount</code>s are not allowed in
accumulated savings is because a percentage
discount is a relative value that depends on the

a <code>DateSavingsSumMap</code>, which is a hash table that

<p>When the user enters a <code>used</code> command, the actions taken by Coupon

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More specifically, the used command executed is
<code>used 1 $100</code>, and the state of the system is such that
a <code>Coupon</code> with <code>PercentageAmount</code> in its <code>Savings</code> (no
<code>MonetaryAmount</code>) and with <code>Usage</code> not at its <code>Limit</code>
is located at index 1. Also, the money symbol
set in the user preferences would be <code>$</code>, which
makes this command a valid one that will execute
successfully.</p>

<p>The money symbol set in the user preferences is
retrieved by <code>CouponStashParser</code>, which passes it
to <code>UsedCommandParser</code> that will use this symbol
to parse the <code>used</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, within <code>UsedCommand</code>, the <code>UsedCommand#execute()</code> method
will cause the creation of a new <code>Coupon</code> with the
correct recorded number of uses and amount of
savings earned. The next sequence diagram shows
how a successful <code>UsedCommand#execute()</code> method produces the new total savings
value for the new <code>Coupon</code>.</p>

<p>In the end, the total savings value of the <code>Coupon</code>
is updated. This total savings is represented by
a <a href="DeveloperGuide.html#dssm">DateSavingsSumMap</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One key implementation within the <code>UsedCommand</code> is the checks
that it has to make to ensure the valid usage of a <code>Coupon</code>.
Below is an activity diagram to show the flow of checks within
the <code>UsedCommand#execute()</code> method.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="implementation-of-saved-command"><a class="link" href="#implementation-of-saved-command">Implementation of saved command</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have seen how the <code>used</code> command works,
we can look at how the <code>saved</code> command works. While
<code>used</code> stores the amount of savings that the user
has earned on a particular day, <code>saved</code> retrieves
the amount of savings earned as recorded by Coupon
Stash, given a particular time period.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The saved command works similarly to the used command,
where a <code>SavedCommandParser</code> will be created by <code>Logic</code>
to split up the raw <code>String</code> into its arguments,
creating a <code>SavedCommand</code>. Let&#8217;s look at how a <code>SavedCommand</code>
would be executed.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 7. Sequence diagram showing the execution of a <code>SavedCommand</code>.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence the <code>SavedCommand</code> loops through all <code>Coupon</code>s to add
up the savings earned from a particular time period,
or from all dates if no time period is specified.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="design-considerations"><a class="link" href="#design-considerations">Design considerations</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on the User Stories, there is a desire for tracking
how much one has saved by using Coupon Stash, as well
as for viewing total savings easily. Below are
some alternative implementations of savings tracking
and viewing that were considered by the developers,
but were rejected in favour of the current
implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatives:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Restrict each <code>Savings</code> to a concrete monetary value</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This would make the implementation of <code>Savings</code> much
simpler, as there would not be a need for separate
classes like <code>PercentageAmount</code>, <code>MonetaryAmount</code> and
<code>Saveable</code>s. However, this might burden the user with
calculating how much they would save in terms of
dollars and cents, when many coupons and discounts
come in the form of certain percentage reductions
of the original price, as well as free gifts or
benefits that cannot be translatable to a concrete
monetary amount.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence, it was decided to rely on a few different
representations of <code>Savings</code> that can be earned from
using a <code>Coupon</code>, as well as a <code>Savings</code> class that
could refer to any of these representations, or
even a logical combination of these representations.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each <code>Coupon</code> stores a <code>MonetaryAmount</code>, <code>PercentageAmount</code>
and <code>Saveables</code> directly</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This would eliminate the need for the intermediary
<code>Savings</code> class and reduce complication in the program
code slightly. But, it would be difficult to ensure
that at least one such field exists in the <code>Coupon</code>,
or guarantee that the <code>Coupon</code> would have one such field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Coupon</code> class would have to hold the logic for
determining whether it had a valid combination of
<code>MonetaryAmount</code>, <code>PercentageAmount</code> and <code>Saveable</code>s,
which does violate Single Responsibility Principle
as the <code>Coupon</code> class now has another reason to change
(if we would want to allow both <code>MonetaryAmount</code> and
<code>PercentageAmount</code> on a <code>Coupon</code> for instance).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence the <code>Savings</code> class was decided to handle this
responsibility, as well as abstract away the
implementation details of the multiple possible
values and combinations of these values. This allows
the <code>Coupon</code> to think in terms of an entire <code>Savings</code>
object, rather than handle multiple different scenarios
depending on which fields it has.</p>
