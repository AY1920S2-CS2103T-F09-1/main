<p>Coupon Stash is a desktop application for keeping track of your
coupons, coupon usage, and coupon savings. Coupon Stash is written
in Java, JavaFX and FXML, by a team of 5 committed individuals
(including me). Featuring a command-line interface as well as
UI elements like calendars and graphs, Coupon Stash is an amazing
application and a prominent highlight of my abilities.</p>

<p>In this section, I will provide a brief summary of my contributions
to Coupon Stash, as well as to documents like the User Guide
and Developer Guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Major enhancement</strong>: The <strong>savings</strong> feature allowing users to
keep track of how much they have saved from using coupons</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tracking savings per usage allows the user see how much they have
saved, over the course of a certain time period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This feature improves the product significantly because a key part
of coupons is the savings and benefits it brings to the user, and so
there is demand for knowing how much benefits you have reaped
easily.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This feature was not easy to add as it required consideration
about the various forms of savings that coupons may offer, such
as a percent off the original price, a flat monetary amount, or
even free gifts. Also, it required integration with other
features, like the "used" feature which allows users
to mark their coupons whenever they use them.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Minor enhancement</strong>: added a "setcurrency" command so users
can customise the application to different regions, which
would be helpful for exchange students for example.</p>

<p>To allow users to keep track of how much they have saved
(after all, the whole point of coupons is to offer

user&#8217;s savings as they use their coupons that are
handled in the application.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to calculate the total amount saved, Coupons also
store information about how much the user saves, and storage
is done at the moment the user uses the coupon. This
information is stored in the form of PureMonetarySavings,
which is a subclass of Savings that never holds
PercentageAmounts. The class diagram below illustrates this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="image"><img src="../images/PureMonetarySavingsClassDiagram.png" alt="PureMonetarySavingsClassDiagram"></span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The reason why PercentageAmounts are not allowed in
accumulated savings is because a percentage
discount is a relative value that depends on the
original price of the product, and cannot be easily
added up in a way that allows users to accurately
measure how much they have saved from their coupons.</p>
</div>
<div id="dssm" class="paragraph">
<p>PureMonetarySavings are stored in
a DateSavingsSumMap, which is a hash table that
links the current date (LocalDate) to the savings
earned (PureMonetarySavings) on that date.
Each Coupon holds a DateSavingsSumMap. The
next image shows the class diagram of the
DateSavingsSumMap.</p>

<p>The following section describes
the processes that follow whenever a user marks a Coupon
as "used" with the <code>used</code> command.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="implementation-of-used-command"><a class="link" href="#implementation-of-used-command">Implementation of used command</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the user enters a <code>used</code> command, the actions taken by Coupon
Stash change depending on whether the Coupon&#8217;s Savings stores
a MonetaryAmount of PercentageAmount. The following activity diagram
shows what happens when the user runs a used command.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/UsedCommandActivityDiagram.png" alt="UsedCommandActivityDiagram">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In terms of the implementation, the next two images
shows the sequence diagram that models the successful
execution of a used command within the actual
program components.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More specifically, the used command executed is
<code>used 1 $100</code>, and the state of the system is such that
a <code>Coupon</code> with <code>PercentageAmount</code> in its <code>Savings</code> (no
<code>MonetaryAmount</code>) and with <code>Usage</code> not at its <code>Limit</code>
is located at index 1. Also, the money symbol
set in the user preferences would be <code>$</code>, which
makes this command a valid one that will execute
successfully.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/UsedCommandSeqDiagram.png" alt="UsedCommandSeqDiagram">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The money symbol set in the user preferences is
retrieved by <code>CouponStashParser</code>, which passes it
to <code>UsedCommandParser</code> that will use this symbol
to parse the <code>used</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, within <code>UsedCommand</code>, the <code>UsedCommand#execute()</code> method
will cause the creation of a new <code>Coupon</code> with the
correct recorded number of uses and amount of
savings earned. The next sequence diagram shows
how a successful <code>UsedCommand#execute()</code> method produces the new total savings
value for the new <code>Coupon</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/UsedExecutionSeqDiagram.png" alt="UsedExecutionSeqDiagram">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the end, the total savings value of the <code>Coupon</code>
is updated. This total savings is represented by
a <a href="DeveloperGuide.html#dssm">DateSavingsSumMap</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One key implementation within the <code>UsedCommand</code> is the checks
that is has to make to ensure the valid usage of a <code>Coupon</code>.
Below is an activity diagram to show the flow of checks within
the <code>UsedCommand#execute()</code> method.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="implementation-of-saved-command"><a class="link" href="#implementation-of-saved-command">Implementation of saved command</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have seen how the used command works,
we can look at how the saved command works. While
<code>used</code> stores the amount of savings that the user
has earned on a particular day, <code>saved</code> retrieves
the amount of savings earned as recorded by Coupon
Stash, given a particular time period.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The saved command works similarly to the used command,
where a SavedCommandParser will be created by Logic
to split up the raw String into its arguments,
creating a SavedCommand. Let&#8217;s look at how a SavedCommand
would be executed.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../images/SavedExecutionSeqDiagram.png" alt="SavedExecutionSeqDiagram">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence the SavedCommand loops through all Coupons to add
up the savings earned from a particular time period,
or from all dates if no time period is specified.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="design-considerations"><a class="link" href="#design-considerations">Design considerations</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Based on the User Stories, there is a desire for tracking
how much one has saved by using Coupon Stash, as well
as for viewing total savings easily. Below are
some alternative implementations of savings tracking
and viewing that were considered by the developers,
but were rejected in favour of the current
implementation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatives:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Restrict each Savings to a concrete monetary value</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This would make the implementation of Savings much
simpler, as there would not be a need for separate
classes like PercentageAmount, MonetaryAmount and
Saveables. However, this might burden the user with
calculating how much they would save in terms of
dollars and cents, when many coupons and discounts
come in the form of certain percentage reductions
of the original price, as well as free gifts or
benefits that cannot be translatable to a concrete
monetary amount.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence, it was decided to rely on a few different
representations of Savings that can be earned from
using a Coupon, as well as a Savings class that
could refer to any of these representations, or
even a logical combination of these representations.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Each Coupon stores a MonetaryAmount, PercentageAmount
and Saveables directly</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This would eliminate the need for the intermediary
Savings class and reduce complication in the program
code slightly. But, it would be difficult to ensure
that at least one such field exists in the Coupon,
or guarantee that the Coupon would have one such field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Coupon class would have to hold the logic for
determining whether it had a valid combination of
MonetaryAmount, PercentageAmount and Saveables,
which does violate Single Responsibility Principle
as the Coupon class now has another reason to change
(if we would want to allow both MonetaryAmount and
PercentageAmount on a Coupon for instance).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hence the Savings class was decided to handle this
responsibility, as well as abstract away the
implementation details of the multiple possible
values and combinations of these values. This allows
the Coupon to think in terms of an entire Savings
object, rather than handle multiple different scenarios
depending on which fields it has.</p>
