== PROJECT: Coupon Stash

---

== Overview

Coupon Stash is a desktop coupons manager that allows users to keep track of
their coupons. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a beautiful
GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 25kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to search for coupons by its expiry date/ month year*
** What it does: allows the user to view all his/ her coupons by the expiry date or the month.
** Justification: This feature is essential for users to keep track of the expiry dates of coupons. The enhancement,
with the calendar, will ensure that users know exactly when their coupons expire and will never forget to use them.
** Highlights: This enhancement ties in closely with the calendar, which indicates if there is any coupon expiring on each date.
It also ties in with other coupon fields to ensure the validity of a coupon (i.e. not expired), such as savings from
the coupon. This feature is critical to the functioning of Coupon Stash as it directly affects the primary functions of
Coupon Stash such as the automatic archiving of expired coupons and setting of a reminder 3 days before the expiry date.

* *Minor enhancements*: added a goto command that allows the user to navigate the calendar using the Command Line Interface
& a copy command that allows the user to copy the details of a coupon to the user's clipboard.
