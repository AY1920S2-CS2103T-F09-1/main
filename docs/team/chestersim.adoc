== PROJECT: Coupon Stash

---

== Overview

Coupon Stash is a desktop coupons manager that allows users to keep track of
their coupons. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a beautiful
GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15kLoC.

== Summary of contributions

* *Major enhancement*: added *the ability to use a coupon* (Pull request
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/80[#80],
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/98[#98])
** What it does: allows the user to keep track of his usage for each and every
coupon.
** Justification: This feature is essential in keeping track of coupons and
also its generated savings.
** Highlights: This enhancement ties in with other coupon fields to ensure
the valid usage of a coupon. From the start date of the coupon, to the type
of savings generated, this feature is critical to the functioning of Coupon Stash.

* *Major enhancement*: added *archiving mechanism* (Pull Request
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/137[#137])
** What it does: automatically archive the coupon when it has expired or
exhausted its usages.
** Justification: This feature declutters the user's visible list of active
coupons, while retaining the ability to access the archived coupons if needed.

** Highlights: Considerations were made on the design of the archiving system, where the
initial phase focused on two separate data files for active and archived coupons. This was
found to be highly coupled, and would increase complexity and maintainability of the
application. This enhancement ties in with the Used and Expiring functionality of
Coupons to ensure correct archiving of coupons.

* *Minor enhancement*: Added shortcut (Ctrl + Q) to quit windows that do not have a CLI in
Coupon Stash (e.g. Coupon, Remind Window), to maintain the ability to use Coupon Stash with
only a keyboard (except scrolling of lists). (Pull Request
https://github.com/AY1920S2-CS2103T-F09-1/main/pull/323[#323])
