=== Adding a coupon: `add`

Adds a coupon. Some fields like `name`, `expiry date` and `savings` are
required.
Optional fields like `promo code` and `tags` may be provided as well.

Format: `add n/NAME e/EXPIRY_DATE s/SAVINGS_OR_FREE_ITEM [sd/START_DATE]
[p/PROMO_CODE]
[c/CONDITIONS] [u/USAGE] [l/USAGE_LIMIT] [s/EXTRA_FREE_ITEMS]... [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A coupon can have any number of tags (including 0)

****
* Coupons must have at least one "savings" value, whether it is
a flat monetary amount (e.g. $1.00), a percentage (e.g. 10%) or
an item (e.g. Free Water Bottle).
* Savings can be represented by multiple free items, but not multiple
monetary amounts or percentage amounts.
* Coupons cannot have both a monetary amount and a percentage amount.
* To add more free items, use the same prefix as before!
****

Examples:

* `add n/The Deck Chicken Rice s/20% s/Free Add Rice sd/5-5-2020 e/6-5-2020
t/value`

number shown in the displayed coupon list. The index *must be a positive
integer* 1, 2, 3, …​

* You can remove all the coupon’s tags by typing t/ without specifying any
tags after it.
* When editing savings, existing savings of the coupon will also
be removed.

****

[WARNING]
Savings cannot be cleared in the same way as clearing tags,
