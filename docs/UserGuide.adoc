== Introduction

Coupon Stash is for SoC students and staff who rightfully *prefer to use a desktop app for managing coupons*.

If you can type fast, CS can get your coupon management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? You should be!!!! Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!
