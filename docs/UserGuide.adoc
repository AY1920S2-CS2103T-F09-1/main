== Introduction

Coupon Stash is for SoC students and staff who rightfully *prefer to use a desktop app for managing coupons*. More importantly, CS is *optimized for those who prefer to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CS can get your coupon management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested? You should be!!!! Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!
