== Quick Start

.  Ensure you have Java (version 11 or above) installed in your
Computer. Java is an application development platform
and version 11 can be downloaded
link:https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html[here].

Coupon Stash.
.  Double-click the file to start the app. The Graphical User
Interface (GUI) should appear in a few
seconds. If nothing occurs, use the command
`java -jar CouponStash.jar` on your computer's Command Line Interface (CLI) to
open the file up.
.  Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.
.  Some example commands you can try:
* *add:* `add n/Domino's Pizza Extra Large s/40% p/ILOVEDOMINOS e/30-4-2020 l/5
          t/pizza t/delivery`
*** adds a coupon named Domino's Pizza Extra Large to the Coupon Stash, with an
expiry date of 30th April 2020, 40% savings with promo code ILOVEDOMINOS, and a
limit of 5 usages.
* *used*: `used 3` : marks the 3rd coupon shown in the current list
as used, and automatically archives it if the limit is reached
* *saved*: `saved` : displays how much you have saved from all coupons
* *exit* : exits the app (your data will be saved automatically)
.  Refer to the <<Features, Features>> section below for the details of each
command.


== User Interface

In this section, we look at the key features of Coupon Stash's
graphical user interface. The interface can be broadly split
into 4 different parts: the different tabs present in the
program (Coupons, Summary and Help), the calendar,
the command input box and the command result box.

image::ug_user_interface.png[]

=== Tabs

Tab selection determines the content shown in the main
window of Coupon Stash.

The tabs can be switched by pressing kbd:[Ctrl] + kbd:[Tab] or
by clicking on the tabs bar on the left side of the application
with the name of the tab you want to switch to. The current
selected tab will be highlighted with a bolder text, and a
darker blue.

image::ug_currently_selected_tab.png[]

[NOTE]
The tabs bar is visible on every single tab! It serves
as a good visual reference to tell you which
tab is currently being displayed.


The following sections explain the different features of
each tab of Coupon Stash, as well as how to use them.

==== Coupons tab

WHen you first start Coupon Stash, the default selected tab
is the coupons tabs. The coupons tab contains a visual
overview of the coupons which you have added to the
application.

[[couponcard]]
===== Coupon card

The coupon card displays information about each coupon, and
it is styled to look like a coupon itself!

[NOTE]
Coupon card duplicates cannot exist!

==== Summary tab

The summary tab provides an overview of how much
you have saved from using coupons in Coupon Stash.

This tab provides an estimate of all the savings
you have accumulated, provided the coupon that resulted
in those savings is still present in Coupon Stash (this
includes <<archive, archived>> coupons). This estimate
is displayed in the form of a monetary amount at the
top of the page, with saved items that may not be easily
quantified displayed in a lime-green box at the side,
preceded by the text "And these saveables too!".

image::ug_summary_tab.png[]

Also, a graph that shows the monetary amount saved
every week is also displayed in the summary tab.
The next section will tell you more about how to
interpret this graph.

===== Savings graph

The savings graph provides a bar chart which holds
statistics on the amount of money saved per week.
The taller the bar, the more savings earned that week.
The exact amount is also shown in white text at the
top of each bar.

In the graph, Monday is taken to be the first day
of a week, and Sunday the last. The date displayed
on the bottom axis corresponds to the first day of that
week (Monday). Earlier weeks are displayed towards
the left, while later weeks are displayed towards
the right (direction of time axis is from left to right).

The graph is drawn based on the latest week in which
coupon usage was recorded by Coupon Stash, and shows
a maximum of 10 bars or 10 weeks of savings before that
latest date.

[TIP]
Any savings that were recorded by Coupon Stash before
the time period of 10 weeks will not be shown in the graph.
However, they can still be calculated using the
<<saved, saved command>>.

image::ug_savings_graph.png[]

[NOTE]
Although the total monetary amount and saveables list
in the summary tab is obtained by adding up all the
savings from every coupon regardless of the date,
the savings graph may not display every weeks' savings
as it only displays up to a maximum of 10 weeks.

==== Help tab

The help tab shows you a short description of how
to use all the commands in Coupon Stash.

[WARNING]
As compared to the User Guide's descriptions, the
descriptions provided in the help tab are less detailed!

=== Calendar

The calendar shows you all the dates this month.

=== Command input box

The command input box is the main way you will interact
with Coupon Stash.

=== Command result box

The command result box shows you messages depending on
whether your command was successful or not.

=== Adding a coupon: `add`

Adds a coupon. Some fields like `name`, `expiry date` and `savings` are
required.
Optional fields like `promo code` and `tags` may be provided as well.

Format: `add n/NAME e/EXPIRY_DATE s/SAVINGS_OR_FREE_ITEM [sd/START_DATE] [r/REMIND_DATE] [p/PROMO_CODE] [c/CONDITIONS] [u/USAGE] [l/USAGE_LIMIT] [s/EXTRA_FREE_ITEMS]... [t/TAG]...`

[TIP]
A coupon can have any number of tags (including 0)

[NOTE]
If unspecified, the default remind date of a coupon will be set to
3 days before the expiry date. Go to <<Reminding of coupon expiry>>  to
learn more about remind dates.

****
* Coupons must have at least one "savings" value, whether it is
a flat monetary amount (e.g. $1.00), a percentage (e.g. 10%) or
an item. (e.g. Free Water Bottle)
* Savings can be represented by multiple free items, but not multiple
monetary amounts or percentage amounts.
* Free item names cannot contain any numbers. (e.g. iPhone 11 is an invalid
free item name as it contains the number 11)
* Coupons cannot have both a monetary amount and a percentage amount.
* To add more free items, use the same prefix as before!
****

Examples:

* `add n/McDonald's McGriddles p/ILOVEMCGRIDDLES e/31-12-2020 s/$2

****
* Edits the coupon at the specified `INDEX`.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the coupon will be removed. (i.e

* You can remove all of a  coupon’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any
tags after it.
* When editing savings, just like tags, existing savings of the coupon will also
be removed.
* Usage cannot be edited.
****

+
Format: `saved`

- If a specific date is given, Coupon Stash will show you savings
earned only on that day.
+
Format: `saved d/DATE_TO_SHOW`

the total savings accumulated over all the dates between that start date
and end date, inclusive of those dates as well.

// end::saved[]

// tag::archive[]
[[archive]]
=== Archiving a coupon: `archive`
Archives a coupon when you want to keep a record of it, without cluttering your
current stash of coupons.

[NOTE]
To view archived coupons, the user can run the <<Listing coupons: `list`, `list
a/`>> command to list all
archived coupons. Alternatively, the <<Locating coupons by name: `find`,
`find`>> command explained below will
search all archived coupons, thus displaying archives that match the supplied
keywords below unarchived coupons. Finally, the
<<Listing all expiring coupons: `expiring`, `expiring`>> command will also
include all archived coupons that are expiring in its results.
Read the section on <<Locating coupons by name: `find`, `find`>> and

=== Unarchiving a coupon: `unarchive`
Unarchive a coupon, thus bringing it back to your active coupons list.

[NOTE]
To unarchive a coupon, you have to make sure that the archived coupon is
visible in the coupon stash first. Read the section on the

you can display archived coupons.

****
* Unarchive the coupon at the specified INDEX.
****

Examples:

* `unarchive 1` +
Unarchive the first coupon in the coupon stash.

=== Locating coupons by name: `find`

Find coupon(s) whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`

****
* The search is case insensitive. e.g mALa will match Mala.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. Rice Chicken will match
Chicken Rice.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. Chicken will not match Chickens.
* Coupons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search).
e.g. Chicken Rice will return Duck Rice, Chicken Chop.
****

[TIP]
For easy finding of coupons, include the store or brand
name in your coupon name!

Examples:

* `find ken` +
For example, coupons with these names would be returned:
**Ken** Kitchen, **KEN** RIDGE Optical, **ken** you build a snowman.

[NOTE]
The <<Locating coupons by name: `find`, `find`>> command searches the
<<Archiving a coupon: `archive`, `archive`>> for matches too. Coupons that are
found
in the <<Archiving a coupon: `archive`, `archive`>> are displayed **below** the
non-archived matches.
// Insert GIF/image

=== Listing all expiring coupons: `expiring`

Shows a list of all your coupons expiring on a date or during a MonthYear.

coupons in its results too. Coupons that are expiring in the archives are
displayed **below** the non-archived matches.
// Insert GIF/image

=== Sorting coupons: `sort`

Sorts the coupons in CouponStash in **ascending** order. It is possible to sort
by coupon name or expiry date.

[NOTE]
The sorting order will persist throughout the runtime of the program.

<<_archiving_a_coupon_archive, archived>> coupons , if they are present on
screen. Archived coupons will always appear **below** active coupons.
// Put GIF here

Format: `sort PREFIX`

****

Remind dates are **only** checked during program launch. Thus, if a day passes
while the program is open, even if there are coupons expiring on the new day,
no new reminder window will open.

As of now, there is no
functionality for the disabling of reminders for coupons. This feature will be
made available in version 2.0.

====
* The format of dates entered via the `r/` field is
in the D-M-YYYY format. (<<coupon-stash-date-format, Coupon Stash date format>>)
====

Examples:

* `add n/McDonald's McGriddles p/ILOVEMCGRIDDLES e/31-12-2020 s/$2
   sd/1-4-2020 l/2 t/value t/savoury`
+
Add a new Coupon without specifying a remind date. Note that the default
remind date is 3 days before the state expiry date: +

* `add n/Grabfood s/40% e/30-4-2020 p/GRAB40 t/delivery r/10-4-2020`
+
Add a new Coupon while specifying a remind date of `10-4-2020`: +

Edit the coupon at index 1 and change its remind date to `10-4-2020`.

=== Saving the data

Coupon data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any
command that changes the data.

There is no need to save manually.

[[KeyboardShortcuts]]
== Keyboard Shortcuts
With Coupon Stash being optimized for efficient command line usage, how can we
not include some nifty keyboard shortcuts to further streamline
your workflow! This section introduces some of the keyboard shortcuts available
for use in this program.

=== Restore previously entered command texts: kbd:[↑] and kbd:[↓]
Pressing the kbd:[↑] keyboard button while the focus is on the command box
allows you to restore the text of the previous executed command. Pressing
the kbd:[↓] keyboard button allows you to revert to a more recently entered
command.

Demonstration:

=== Close expanded coupon or reminder windows: kbd:[Ctrl]+kbd:[q]
After <<_displaying_a_coupon_expand, `expanding`>> a coupon, you can close
the expanded coupon window by keeping the focus on the coupon window and
pressing the keyboard buttons kbd:[Ctrl] and kbd:[q] simultaneously. This
shortcut also works for closing <<_reminding_of_coupon_expiry, reminder>>
windows.

Demonstration:

=== Cycle through tabs: kbd:[Ctrl]+kbd:[Tab]
You can press the keyboard buttons kbd:[Ctrl] and kbd:[Tab] simultaneously to
switch tabs. Do note that the focus has to be on the main panel before the
key presses would work.

== Appendix

This section talks about features that have not been
implemented in Coupon Stash yet, but features that
the developers are keen to add in upcoming versions.

=== *Query expressions (coming in v2.0)*

Query expressions serve to enable users to perform efficient batch
operations on stored coupons using SQL-like syntax.

Examples:

* `edit favorites set tag=hated where expiry < 19-2-2020` +
For all coupons tagged as ``favorites'', set their tag to ``hated'' if
they expire before the 19th Feb 2020.

* `delete favorites where expiry < 19-2-2020` +
For all coupons tagged as ``favorites'', delete them if they expire
before the 19th Feb 2020.


==== *Bulk edit*

Format: `edit _tag_ set _field1=value1, field2=value2, …_ [where
condition]`

* The `edit` keyword is compulsory.
** If selecting all tags, put tag as `*`.
* The `set` keyword is compulsory.
** If the field is present in a coupon, update the value, else create
the field and value.
** At least 1 field must be updated/added per edit operation.
* The `where` keyword is optional.
** The `==`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, `!=`, operators are
supported in the condition.
** Only default fields can be compared.
** Condition syntax: `DEFAULT_FIELD _operator_ LITERAL_VALUE`
** `AND`/`OR` functionality is not available.

==== *Bulk delete*

Format: `delete _tag_ [where condition]`

* The `delete` keyword is compulsory.
** If selecting all tags, put tag as `*`.
* The `where` keyword is optional.
** If the `where` keyword is omitted, deletes all coupons with that tag.
** Follows syntax explained above.
