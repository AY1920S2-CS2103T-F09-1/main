== Introduction

Coupon Stash is for SoC students and staff who rightfully *prefer to use a desktop
app for managing coupons*. More importantly, CS is *optimized for those who prefer
to work with a Command Line Interface* (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, CS can get your coupon
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Interested?
You should be!!!! Jump to the Section 2, “Quick Start” to get started. Enjoy!

.  Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds.
.  Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. +
e.g. typing *help* and pressing Enter will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:
* *list* : lists all coupons
* *add:* `add n/Domino's Pizaa Extra Large s/40% p/ILOVEDOMINOS e/30-4-2020 l/5
          t/pizza t/delivery`: adds a coupon named Domino's Pizaa Extra Large to the Coupon Stash, with an expiry date of 30th April 2020, 40% savings with promo code ILOVEDOMINOS, and a limit of 5 usages.
* *delete*: `delete 3` : deletes the 3rd coupon shown in the current list
* *exit* : exits the app (your data will be saved automatically)
