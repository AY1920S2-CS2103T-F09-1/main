== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/Main.java[`Main`] and
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a coupon).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference.
This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.
An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `csdev.couponstash.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature

==== Proposed Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `couponStashStateList` with a `commandTextHistory` and `currStateIndex`. All these components are encapsulated in the `HistoryManager` class.
The following methods in the `Model` interface facilitates this feature:

* `Model#commitCouponStash(String commandText)` -- Saves the current coupon stash state and the command text that triggered the change in state into `HistoryManager`.
* `Model#undo()` -- Restores the previous coupon stash state from `HistoryManager`.
* `Model#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone coupon stash state from `HistoryManager`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `CouponStash` will be initialized with the initial coupon stash state, and the `currStateIndex` pointing to that single coupon stash state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th coupon in the coupon stash.
The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCouponStash(String commandText)`, causing the modified state of the coupon stash after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `couponStashStateList`, and the `delete 5` command text to be stored in the `commandTextHistory`.  `currStateIndex` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/OMO STORE ...` to add a new coupon.
The `add` command also calls `Model#commitCouponStash(String commandText)`, causing another modified coupon stash state and command text to be saved into the `couponStashStateList` and `commandTextHistory` respectively.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCouponStash(String commandText)`, so the address book state and command text will not be saved.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the coupon was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCouponStash()`, which will shift the `currStateIndex` once to the left, pointing it to the previous coupon stash state, and restores the coupon stash to that state. Plus, the command text is returned, thus allowing for the display of the command that was undone. In this case, the command undone is `add n/OMO STORE...`.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currStateIndex` is at index 0, pointing to the initial coupon stash state, then there are no previous coupon stash states to restore.
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCouponStash()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoCouponStash()`, which shifts the `currStateIndex` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state and command text, and restores the coupon stash to that state. Finally, it returns the redone command text.

[NOTE]
If the `currStateIndex` is at index `couponStashStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest coupon stash state, then there are no undone coupon stash states to restore.
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCouponStash()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`.
Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will  not call `Model#commitCouponStash()`.
Thus, the `couponStashStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCouponStash()`.
Since the `currStateIndex` is not pointing at the end of the `couponStashStateList`, all coupon stash states and command text history after the `currStateIndex` will be purged.
We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/OMO STORE ...` command.
This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

*  Saves the entire coupon stash.
** Each coupon is copied into `HistoryManager`, thus eliminating any chance for bugs when mutating coupons.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* Use two lists to store the history of address book states and command text history.
** The lists are stored in a `HistoryManager` class, which includes a `currStateIndex`.
// end::undoredo[]

=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).
