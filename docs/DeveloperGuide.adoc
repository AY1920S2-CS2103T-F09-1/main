== Setting up

Refer to the guide <<SettingUp#, here>>.

== Design

[[Design-Architecture]]
=== Architecture

.Architecture Diagram
image::ArchitectureDiagram.png[]

The *_Architecture Diagram_* given above explains the high-level design of the App.
Given below is a quick overview of each component.

[TIP]
The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the link:{repoURL}/docs/diagrams/[diagrams] folder.
Refer to the <<UsingPlantUml#, Using PlantUML guide>> to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

`Main` has two classes called link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/Main.java[`Main`] and
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/MainApp.java[`MainApp`].
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup method where necessary.

<<Design-Commons,*`Commons`*>> represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
The following class plays an important role at the architecture level:

* `LogsCenter` : Used by many classes to write log messages to the App's log file.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* <<Design-Ui,*`UI`*>>: The UI of the App.
* <<Design-Logic,*`Logic`*>>: The command executor.
* <<Design-Model,*`Model`*>>: Holds the data of the App in-memory.
* <<Design-Storage,*`Storage`*>>: Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components

* Defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Exposes its functionality using a `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines it's API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class.

==== How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

.Component interactions for `delete 1` command
image::ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png[]

The sections below give more details of each component.

[[Design-Ui]]
=== UI component

.Structure of the UI Component
image::UiClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/ui/Ui.java[`Ui.java`]

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of three main parts - `CommandBox`, `CalendarResultDisplayPanel` and  `CouponListPanel`.
All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework.
The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/ui/MainWindow.java[`MainWindow`] is specified in link:{repoURL}/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml[`MainWindow.fxml`]

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

[[Design-Logic]]
=== Logic component

[[fig-LogicClassDiagram]]
.Structure of the Logic Component
image::LogicClassDiagram.png[]

*API* :
link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/logic/Logic.java[`Logic.java`]

. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a coupon).
. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

.Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command
image::DeleteSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

[[Design-Model]]
=== Model component

.Structure of the Model Component
image::ModelClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/model/Model.java[`Model.java`]

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user's preferences.
* stores the Address Book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.

[NOTE]
As a more OOP model, we can store a `Tag` list in `Address Book`, which `Person` can reference.
This would allow `Address Book` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.
An example of how such a model may look like is given below. +
 +
image:BetterModelClassDiagram.png[]

[[Design-Storage]]
=== Storage component

.Structure of the Storage Component
image::StorageClassDiagram.png[]

*API* : link:{repoURL}/src/main/java/csdev/couponstash/storage/Storage.java[`Storage.java`]

The `Storage` component,

* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the Address Book data in json format and read it back.

[[Design-Commons]]
=== Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `csdev.couponstash.commons` package.

== Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

// tag::undoredo[]
=== Undo/Redo feature

==== Current Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `couponStashStateList` with a `commandTextHistory` and `currStateIndex`. All these components are encapsulated in the `HistoryManager` class.
The following methods in the `Model` interface facilitates this feature:

* `Model#commitCouponStash(String commandText)` -- Saves the current coupon stash state and the command text that triggered the change in state into `HistoryManager`.
* `Model#undo()` -- Restores the previous coupon stash state from `HistoryManager`.
* `Model#redo()` -- Restores a previously undone coupon stash state from `HistoryManager`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The `CouponStash` will be initialized with the initial coupon stash state, and the `currStateIndex` pointing to that single coupon stash state.

image::UndoRedoState0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th coupon in the coupon stash.
The `delete` command calls `Model#commitCouponStash(String commandText)`, causing the modified state of the coupon stash after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `couponStashStateList`, and the `delete 5` command text to be stored in the `commandTextHistory`.  `currStateIndex` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

image::UndoRedoState1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `add n/OMO STORE ...` to add a new coupon.
The `add` command also calls `Model#commitCouponStash(String commandText)`, causing another modified coupon stash state and command text to be saved into the `couponStashStateList` and `commandTextHistory` respectively.

image::UndoRedoState2.png[]

[NOTE]
If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitCouponStash(String commandText)`, so the address book state and command text will not be saved.

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the coupon was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command.
The `undo` command will call `Model#undoCouponStash()`, which will shift the `currStateIndex` once to the left, pointing it to the previous coupon stash state, and restores the coupon stash to that state. Plus, the command text is returned, thus allowing for the display of the command that was undone. In this case, the command undone is `add n/OMO STORE...`.

image::UndoRedoState3.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currStateIndex` is at index 0, pointing to the initial coupon stash state, then there are no previous coupon stash states to restore.
The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoCouponStash()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

image::UndoSequenceDiagram.png[]

NOTE: The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The `redo` command does the opposite -- it calls `Model#redoCouponStash()`, which shifts the `currStateIndex` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state and command text, and restores the coupon stash to that state. Finally, it returns the redone command text.

[NOTE]
If the `currStateIndex` is at index `couponStashStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest coupon stash state, then there are no undone coupon stash states to restore.
The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoCouponStash()` to check if this is the case.
If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`.
Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will  not call `Model#commitCouponStash()`.
Thus, the `couponStashStateList` remains unchanged.

image::UndoRedoState4.png[]

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitCouponStash()`.
Since the `currStateIndex` is not pointing at the end of the `couponStashStateList`, all coupon stash states and command text history after the `currStateIndex` will be purged.
We designed it this way because it no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/OMO STORE ...` command.
This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

image::UndoRedoState5.png[]

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

image::CommitActivityDiagram.png[]

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: How undo & redo executes

*  Saves the entire coupon stash.
** Each coupon is copied into `HistoryManager`, thus eliminating any chance for bugs when mutating coupons.

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the undo/redo commands

* Use two lists to store the history of address book states and command text history.
** The lists are stored in a `HistoryManager` class, which includes a `currStateIndex`.
// end::undoredo[]

// tag::calendar[]
=== Calendar

==== Current Implementation
The Calendar component provides a visual representation of the stored coupons that are expiring over a month. It is
facilitated by the `CalendarPane`, `DateCell` and `CouponsOnDateWindow`.

The `CalendarPane` is controller of the `Calendar`. Users can change the month on display and open a `CouponsOnDateWindow`
to show the coupons that expire on a date by clicking on a highlighted `DateCell`.

Each `DateCell` represents each date of the month that is currently on display.


The `ObservableList<Coupon>` is the list of filtered coupons that are currently on display in the `CouponListPanel`.
They are obtained by calling the `Logic#getFilteredCouponList()` method. Each `DateCell` uses the same
`ObservableList<Coupon>` as reference, to get coupons that expires on each of the dates.

The sequence diagrams below show how the Calendar works:

image::CalendarSequenceDiagram.png[]
image::CalendarSequenceDiagram_Ref_SetDetailsOfDateCell.png[]

The two scenarios below are examples of how the Calendar mechanism behaves at each step of each scenario.

===== Updating the Calendar with a Filtered List
The Calendar updates with the current observable coupon list. The following steps describes how this behavior is implemented.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.
The Calendar displayed will render the saved data, triggered by the initiation of the UiManager.

Step 2. The user executes a `find` command.
The `find` command alters the observable coupon list and the Calendar will be updated according to the list with the
`Logic#getFilteredCouponList()` method.


===== Selecting a highlighted date on the Calendar
Dates that have coupons expiring on that day are highlighted and clickable. The user can click on them and open a separate
window to view all the coupons that are expiring on that day. The following steps describes how this behavior is implemented.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time or changes the month displayed on the Calendar.
The Calendar displayed will render the expiring coupons for the month and highlight the dates with expiring coupons
facilitated by the `CalendarPane#setDateCellCircle` method.
Example of highlighted date:

image::Calendar_HighlightedCell.png[]

Step 2. The user clicks on a highlighted date.
A new separate window will open, showing the user all the coupons that are expiring on that particular day facilitated
by the `DateCell#displayCoupons()` method.
Example of new window:

image::Calendar_CouponsOnDateWindow.png[]


==== Design Considerations
===== Aspect: Information displayed on the Calendar
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show expiring coupons by highlighting the dates with expiring coupons and users
clicking on them for more information in a separate window
** Pros: Cleaner view of the Calendar with minimal information
** Cons: Lesser information provided with a glance and user have to click to see the details of the expiring coupons on
a date in a separate window

* **Alternative 2:** Show a condensed version of the coupons in the cell of each date
** Pros: No additional clicking required and more information provided with a glance
** Cons: May be messy to look at when there are multiple coupons expiring on a date


===== Aspect: Whether the Calendar should update with the list
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Calender updates with the filtered list
** Pros: User can relate the coupons shown in the Calendar to the `CouponListPanel` (Observer design pattern)
** Cons: May overlook coupons if list is filtered

* **Alternative 2:** Calendar shows all the coupons in CouponStash
** Pros: View of all coupons and will not overlook any coupons when the coupon list is filtered
** Cons: User may be confused if he/she sees a coupon on the Calendar that is not in the `CouponListPanel`


=== Logging

We are using `java.util.logging` package for logging.
The `LogsCenter` class is used to manage the logging levels and logging destinations.

* The logging level can be controlled using the `logLevel` setting in the configuration file (See <<Implementation-Configuration>>)
* The `Logger` for a class can be obtained using `LogsCenter.getLogger(Class)` which will log messages according to the specified logging level
* Currently log messages are output through: `Console` and to a `.log` file.

*Logging Levels*

* `SEVERE` : Critical problem detected which may possibly cause the termination of the application
* `WARNING` : Can continue, but with caution
* `INFO` : Information showing the noteworthy actions by the App
* `FINE` : Details that is not usually noteworthy but may be useful in debugging e.g. print the actual list instead of just its size

[[Implementation-Configuration]]
=== Configuration

Certain properties of the application can be controlled (e.g user prefs file location, logging level) through the configuration file (default: `config.json`).

[[Implementation-Coupon-Archiving]]
=== Coupon Archiving

==== Current Implementation
The archiving of coupons is facilitated by the `Archived` attribute of a coupon. The following methods in the `CouponStash`,
`Coupon`, `Usage` class and the `Model` interface facilitates this feature:

* `CouponStash#archiveExpiredCoupons()` -- Archives any coupon in the CouponStash that has expired, and returns a new updated CouponStash.
* `Coupon#increaseUsageByOne()` - Increases the usage of a coupon by one.
* `Usage#isUsageAtLimit` - Returns true if the current usage is at its limit (abstracted by the `Limit` field).
* `Model#PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_ACTIVE_COUPONS` - A Predicate function that filters out archived coupons from a given CouponStash.

Given below is two example usage scenarios and how the archiving mechanism behaves at each step of each scenario.

image::ArchivingClassDiagram.png[]

===== Archiving of Expired Coupons

Expired coupons are automatically archived by Coupon Stash upon start up of the application. The following steps describe
how this behaviour is implemented.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The initiation of `ModelManager` will also trigger the
initiation of `CouponStash` with any available saved data.

Step 2. The method `CouponStash#archiveExpiredCoupons` will be called from the newly initiated `CouponStash`, and have its
`UniqueCouponList` mapped to a function that archive coupons that have expired before the date of opening the application,
and returns a new updated `CouponStash`.

Step 3. The `ModelManager` will proceed to filter out the archived coupons from the newly updated `CouponStash`, and return
a filtered list of active coupons. This filtering is facilitated by the predicate `Model#PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_ACTIVE_COUPONS`.

image::ArchiveExpiredSequenceDiagram.png[]

===== Archiving of Exhausted Coupons

Coupons that have exhausted its usages will be automatically archived by the application. The following steps describe how
this behaviour is implemented.

Step 1. The user uses a coupon in the current observable `CouponStash` with the command `used 1`.
The particular coupon will then have its usage increased by one.

Step 2. The coupon will then be checked if its usage has reached its limit. For the purpose of this
explanation, we assume that the coupon being used has a usage limit of 1 and a previous usage value of 0,
with savings in `MonetaryAmount`.

Step 3. The coupon will have a new `Archived` value, which will be set to `true` if the usage has indeed reached its limit.

Step 4. The `CouponStash` will be updated with this used coupon with the `ModelManager#setCoupon()` method. Under the hood of
this method, the current filtered list will be be updated to show active coupons only, facilitated by the predicate
`Model#PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_ACTIVE_COUPONS`.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: The implementation to store archived coupons

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Coupon` contains an `Archived` field
** Pros: Easy to implement, lower maintainability.
** Cons: Saved data may get get considerably huge after heavy usage of application.

* **Alternative 2:** Archived coupons are stored in another separate data file.
** Pros: Separates the logic between the two different `CouponStash`, e.g. you can limit the functions on archived coupons
** Cons: Sharply increases the maintainability and coupling of the application with two data files.

// tag::updownarrowcommandhistory[]
=== Up/down arrow command history

==== Current Implementation
The retrieving of command history via the up and down arrow keys is facilitated
by the `CommandTextHistory` class. The command history is stored internally as a `LinkedList` used as a stack with a `currIndex`
tracking the next command in the history to return.
The following methods in the `CommandTextHistory`
class facilitates this feature:

* `CommandTextHistory#add(String commandText)`
* `CommandTextHistory#getDown()`
* `CommandTextHistory#getUp()`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the up/down button presses behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `CommandTextHistory` is initialized
with a `LinkedList` containing only an empty string (`""`), and the `currIndex` is set to `0`.

image::UpDownHistory0.png[]

Step 2. The user executes `delete 1`. `CommandBox#handleCommandEntered()` will call `CommandTextHistory#add(String commandText)` to save the entered command into
the stack contained in `CommandTextHistory`. The top of the stack (i.e. the empty string) is popped off first, before
the entered command is pushed onto the stack. Then, the empty string is pushed onto the stack again, thus ensuring that
the empty string stays at the top of the stack. Note that `currIndex` is not affected.

image::UpDownHistory1.png[]

Step 3. The user executes `delete 2`. `CommandBox#handleCommandEntered()` will also save the entered command into
the stack contained in `CommandTextHistory`. As in the previous step, the new command is pushed to the top of the stack,
just below the empty string.

image::UpDownHistory2.png[]

Step 3. Now, the user decides to delete the second coupon again. We press the arrow key up once,
and `CommandBox#commandTextField` has a listener that calls `CommandTextHistory#getUp()`.
The `currIndex` is incremented, and then the command text pointed to by `currIndex` is returned and
displayed in the program command box.

image::UpDownHistory3.png[]

Step 4. The user then executes the retrieved command (`delete 2`). As in the previous steps, this newly executed command
is pushed to the top of the stack just below the empty string. However, in such a case when the `currIndex` is not `0` and
does not point to the top of the stack, it is reset to `0`.

image::UpDownHistory4.png[]

[NOTE]
If the `currStateIndex` is pointing to the top of the stack,
then there are no previous commands to retrieve. Thus, the up button will simply
return the empty string. No changes to the stack and `currIndex` will be effected.

The down arrow key does the opposite, it will lead to the calling of `CommandTextHistory#getDown()`,
which shifts the `currIndex` one item higher (i.e. decrement the `currIndex` by `1`), before returning
the command text pointed by the updated `currIndex`.

[NOTE]
If the `currIndex` is at index `commandTextHistory.size() - 1`, pointing to the
bottom of the stack, there is no next command to retrieve when pressing the down key. Thus,
the down button will simple return the command text currently being pointed to by the `currIndex`.
No changes to the stack and `currIndex` will be effected.

==== Design Considerations

===== Aspect: Data structure to support the key actions

* We used a `LinkedList` as a stack to store the command text history.
** The first in first out nature of a stack made it a very suitable data structure
for the storage of history that is retrived in chronological order of execution.
// end::updownarrowcommandhistory[]


=== Coupon Reminder

==== Current Implementation

The coupon reminder provides a visual alert through a pop-up box, upon launching the application, whenever there are coupon(s) that
are set to be reminded on a certain date.

This reminder feature is facilitated by the Remind attribute of a coupon. The followings methods in the  RemindCommand Class,
'Model' interface, "ui" interface facilitates this feature:

* RemindCommand#ShowRemind - Will execute checking of all coupons and alert the user when
